            My name is Evy. Iâ€™m a studying front-end developer coming from the
            backend like Java and other back-end technologies. Now I am learning
            React to increase my front-end skills after I have just completed a
            full Javascript course. My goal is to get further training in a
            place with a teamwork environment. I am enthusiastic, friendly and a
            real team player.{' '}
